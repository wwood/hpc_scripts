# mqsub
mqsub aims to be an ergonomic method for submitting jobs to the PBS queue. It dynamically generates a qsub script, submits it, 
waits for the result and then emails you to say it is done.

A straightforward example:

```
$ mqsub -- echo hello world
12/23/2020 10:38:30 AM INFO: qsub stdout was: 8690551.pbs
12/23/2020 10:38:30 AM INFO: First status of job is: Q: Job is queued
12/23/2020 10:41:31 AM INFO: Now status of job is: F: Job is finished
12/23/2020 10:41:31 AM INFO: Job has finished
12/23/2020 10:41:31 AM INFO: resources_used.walltime: 00:00:01
12/23/2020 10:41:31 AM INFO: resources_used.cpupercent: 0
12/23/2020 10:41:31 AM INFO: resources_used.cput: 00:00:00
12/23/2020 10:41:31 AM INFO: resources_used.vmem: 67728kb
hello world
```

From there the behaviour can be modified in several ways, using the optional arguments. For instance to request 1 hour instead of 1 week:

```
$ mqsub --hours 1 -- echo hi
```

There are several other options, which can be viewed with `mqsub -h`
```mqsub -h

If you have a large amount of commands (one command per line in a single file) you wish to split in a number of qsub jobs, you can do the following:
```
mqsub --command-file <file> --chunk-num <int>
```
or
```
mqsub --command-file <file> --chunk-size <int>
```
As per regular mqsub you should specify the amount of resource for the qsub scripts, i.e:
```
mqsub -t 16 -m 32 --hours 24 --command-file <file> --chunk-num <int>
```

You can also speed up some of your processes by copying data files to a node's SSD prior to running commands. One good use would to copy a database to the SSD and then run a chunk of commands (as per above). To do this, use the `--scratch-data` option for which multiple paths can be specified. In your mqsub some command you'll need to adjust how you specify the location of the copied files (which are copied to $TMPDIR), for example:
```
mqsub --scratch-data ~/gtdb_r207.reassigned.v5.sdb ~/S3.metapackage_20220513.smpkg -- singlem --db1 \$TMPDIR/gtdb_r207.reassigned.v5.sdb \$TMPDIR/S3.metapackage_20220513.smpkg
```

Certain workflows demand a lot of IO (for example: assemblies, or any multiple instances of a program run in parrallel). This can put strain upon the filesystem and it's reccomended to run these workflows on the 1TB SSD of each node. To do this, specify `--run-tmp-dir`, and your the files in your output directory will be processed on the SSD and then copied back to your current working directory once complete. You can use this functionality for regular mqsub, as well as chunks (the output will be moved back to Lustre once all jobs in the chunk complete).
**IMPORTANT:** you must specify absolute paths to your input files and a relative path for your output directory. For example:
```
mqsub \
-t 32 \
-m 250 \
-- aviary complete \
--pe-1 /work/microbiome/human/fastq/reads_R1.fastq.gz \
--pe-2 /work/microbiome/human/fastq/reads_R2.fastq.gz \
--output aviary_output1 \
--run-tmp-dir

```


# mqstat
To view useful usage statistics (i.e. the percentage of microbiome queue CPUs which are currently in-use/available) simply type `mqstat`. Example output:
```
Microbiome group jobs running: 4 / 4 (100.00%)
Microbiome group CPUs utilized: 120 / 512 (23.44%)
Microbiome group CPUs queued: 0
sternesp jobs running: 0 / 0 (0.0%)
sternesp CPUs running: 0 / 512 (0.0%)
sternesp CPUs queued: 0
Non-microbiome group jobs / CPU: 0 / 0 (0.0%)
```

You can also view a detailed breakdown queued and running jobs on a per-user basis by typing `mqstat --list`. Example output:
```
List of jobs in queue:
----------------------
PBS ID      | username  | name        | state | CPUs | RAM   | walltime (hrs) | start time               | elapsed time         | % walltime | microbiome queue | node       
----------- | --------- | ----------- | ----- | ---- | ----- | -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | -----------
9524869.pbs | n10853499 | Rhys Newell | R     | 48   | 480gb | 84             | Tue Jun  8 03:02:37 2021 | 2 day, 6 hr, 19 min  | 64         | yes              | cl5n013/0*0
9524870.pbs | n10853499 | Rhys Newell | R     | 48   | 480gb | 84             | Tue Jun  8 20:57:54 2021 | 1 day, 12 hr, 24 min | 43         | yes              | cl5n012/0*0

Time left until maintenance (hr:min:sec): 1999:37:25
```

Furthermore, you can also view the amount of available resources per-node basis by typing `mqstat --avail`. This can help you plan on how many resources to request. In the example below, if you were to request 49+ CPUs your job will be held in the queue until that amount of resource is available on a single node.
```
Available resources:
--------------------
node    | CPU        | RAM   
------- | ---------- | ------
cl5n010 | 0 threads  | 560 GB
cl5n011 | 16 threads | 550 GB
cl5n012 | 48 threads | 480 GB
cl5n013 | 1 threads  | 356 GB
```


# mqwait
If you are running a batch of jobs, you may wish to be notified once the entire batch has finished processing, as opposed to per-job notifications generated by mqsub. There are three ways to run mqwait:

1) Typing `mqwait` will send you an email once all your current running and queued jobs finish.

2) You can specify a newline delimited list of PBS jobs you wish to be notified by. ie. `mqwait -i pbs_job_list`
In this example pbs_job_list would contain:
```
123456.pbs
123457.pbs
123458.pbs
```

3) You can also pipe multiple mqsubs (using parallel or a script containing mqsub commands) in a single command to be notified when that specific batch of jobs finish. Note: currently the STDERR from mqsub is piped into mqwait using |&. This may change in future.
`parallel mqsub --no-email --bg ... |& mqwait -m` or `mqsub_jobs.sh |& mqwait -m`

Specifying the `-l` parameter will verbosely display the number of remaining jobs on your terminal and it controlled by the polling rate `-p` (default 60 seconds)


# mcreate
This is a basic script which searches for the latest version of conda package and creates a new, versioned, environment using conda (with the `-c` parameter) or mamba (default; requires mamba to be installed first).

Simply: `mcreate <package_name>`

You can also check for the latest version of a package without installing:
`mcreate <package_name> -v`


# pixi_cmr_init
This script initializes a pixi project with CMR-specific settings. It creates a `pixi.toml` file using `pixi init` and modifies the channels to include `bioconda` after `conda-forge`. It also creates a `.pixi` directory in a centralized location and symlinks it to the project directory.

Basic usage:
```bash
pixi_cmr_init.py                    # Initialize in current directory
pixi_cmr_init.py /path/to/project   # Initialize in specific directory
pixi_cmr_init.py --dry-run          # Show what would be done without executing
```

Features:
- Automatically adds `bioconda` channel after `conda-forge` in the channels list
- Creates `.pixi` directory in `/pkg/cmr/<username>/pixi_dirs/<path>.pixi` for centralized storage
- Creates a symlink from project directory to the centralized `.pixi` directory
- Falls back to local `.pixi` directory if centralized location is not accessible
- Warns if `.pixi` directory or symlink already exists
- Supports dry-run mode to preview changes
- Works with or without the `toml` Python package (uses fallback parsing if needed)

Directory Structure:
- Actual `.pixi` directory: `/pkg/cmr/<username>/pixi_dirs/<project_path>.pixi`
- Symlink in project: `<project_directory>/.pixi -> /pkg/cmr/<username>/pixi_dirs/<project_path>.pixi`
- Path conversion: `/home/user/project` becomes `home_user_project.pixi`

Example output:
```bash
$ pixi_cmr_init.py /home/user/my_project
Initializing pixi project in: /home/user/my_project
Running 'pixi init'...
Modified /home/user/my_project/pixi.toml to include bioconda channel
Channels: ['conda-forge', 'bioconda']
Created .pixi directory at /pkg/cmr/user/pixi_dirs/home_user_my_project.pixi
Created symlink: /home/user/my_project/.pixi -> /pkg/cmr/user/pixi_dirs/home_user_my_project.pixi
pixi_cmr_init completed successfully!
```

Fallback behavior:
If `/pkg/cmr/<username>/pixi_dirs/` is not accessible (e.g., permissions, directory doesn't exist), the script automatically falls back to creating a local `.pixi` directory in the project folder.
